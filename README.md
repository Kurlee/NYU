This is a simple Python program that ask multiple choice questions to users. 
The goal is to help my fellow students a the Computer Networking class at NYU School of Tandon. 
The book we refer "Computer Networking, A Top-Down Approach, 7th Edition" by Kurose & Ross. 
I got the idea to build this program from a Youtuber, so full credits goes to him,I just use his coding and did some improvements.
